Welcome to the **Waikereru Ecosanctuary** - an Ark in the Bush. The Ecosanctuary is a haven for rare and endangered species of native birds, plants and animals. It is reached by a winding gravel road up an inland valley, just 9 kilometres from Gisborne city on the Tai Rawhiti / East Coast of New Zealand.

From high hill ridges to the west, three streams tumble down steep valleys and across a plain, entering the Waimatā River to the east. A rare surviving strip of lowland bush (Longbush Reserve) runs beside the Waimatā River. The bush is alive with the sound of birds, including tui, bellbirds, fantails, kingfishers, whiteheads and many kereru or native pigeons.

## Nau mai, haere mai!

**Visiting Waikereru**

Waikereru is on land owned by Dame Anne and Jeremy Salmond.  ***Longbush Reserve*** is open to the public – access is on the right, opposite 910 Riverside Road.

***Waikereru Ecosanctuary*** (including the *Welcome Shelter* and *1769 Garden*) can be [visited by arrangement](mailto:info@waikereru.org) – please contact us at [info@waikereru.org](mailto:info@waikereru.org). Access is on the left, at 846 Riverside Road.

We treat the Ecosanctuary like a marae – visitors are very welcome, but the trustees need to know you’re coming! The Waikereru Hills are actively managed, with trapping and shooting. For health and safety reasons, access is by specific arrangement only.

As visitors, please note you're responsible for your own health and safety.  Stay on the tracks, be careful around electric fences, traps and streams, and take care of our precious bush.
