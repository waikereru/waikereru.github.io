This beautiful image from Simon Devitt captures the ancestral maunga Motukeo as reflected in the Claude Glass at Waikereru, designed by Sarosh Mulla.

This artwork is based on the original 'Claude glass,' a small black slightly convex mirror, often made from obsidian, used by landscape painters to shrink the scene they were painting to a manageable size.  They'd sit with their back to the landscape, facing the Claude Glass, and paint the reduced image.
