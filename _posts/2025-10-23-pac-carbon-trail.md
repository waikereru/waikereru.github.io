Over the past two years, we've been working with [PAC Studio](https://www.pacstudio.nz/) and Sarosh Mulla, the architect who designed our award-winning [Welcome Shelter](https://www.pacstudio.nz/project/waikereru-welcome-shelter), on an innovative programme to offset emissions from their design work and projects with gold standard carbon credits from Waikereru.

Sarosh and his partners have teamed up with CarbonTrail to track the emissions from their office work and projects, and to offset them in a way that helps to support our restoration and research programmes at Waikereru.  A classic win-win, with their University of Auckland research into minimising emissions in architectural practice with our research-based programme of ecological restoration.
