In Scotland, we had dinner in Kilmarten with [Gordon Gray Stephens](https://savingscotlandsrainforest.org.uk/the-team), Saving Scotland's Rainforest advisor, and discussed the research they're doing into their own temperate rain forests. 

He's putting us in touch with a PhD student from Kew who's studying the underground life of these forests. Fascinating, and promising.
