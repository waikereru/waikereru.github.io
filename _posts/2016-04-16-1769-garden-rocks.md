Last week Phillip Smith and James Fischer from 02 Landscapes joined Jeremy Salmond and Malcolm Rutherford, Curator at the 1769 Seed Archive, building the stone rows and mounds in front of the Welcome Shelter. So exciting to see this marvellous garden, which features the plants collected by Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander on the Tai Rawhiti in 1769, taking taking shape for the 250th anniversary of the Endeavour's arrival in 2019.
