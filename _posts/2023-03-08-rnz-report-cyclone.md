Listen to this [RNZ report from Matthew Rosenberg](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2018880739/around-the-motu-matthew-rosenberg-in-gisborne) on the current state of affairs at home in TÅ«ranga - and so awesome to hear him talking about the impact of the cyclone on the [Wild Lab Tiaki Taiao](/wildlab/), with our waiting list of a year, fabulous stoat costume and kids dying to get back.

[Around the motu: Matthew Rosenberg in Gisborne](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2018880739/around-the-motu-matthew-rosenberg-in-gisborne) (RNZ)

We've had to suspend the programme because of the state of Riverside Road, but the teachers are desperate to get it going again, because the kids really need it at the moment.  Kids, parents and teachers all love the Wild Lab - the immersion in the bush, streams and hills at Waikereru, the brilliant costumes designed by Brighde Penn (who grew up next door and has designed costumes for Dr. Who in the UK), and the marvellous, exciting and uplifting activities led by the Wild Lab team.
