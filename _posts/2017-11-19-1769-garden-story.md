Another story about Waikereru / Longbush and the fabulous people who help us to make it such a special place.

In her narration, the wonderful Alison Ballance from '[Our Changing World](http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ourchangingworld/)' speaks about 2019 as a 'celebration' of Cook's arrival - in Tairawhiti we talk about a 'commemoration' instead, because those first encounters were not all sweetness and light!

The collaboration between Philip Smith ([02 Landscapes](http://www.o2landscapes.com/)), Graeme Atkins ([DOC](http://www.doc.govt.nz/), [Ngati Porou](http://www.ngatiporou.com/nati-life/welcome-ngati-porou)) and Malcolm Rutherford ([QEII](http://www.openspace.org.nz/), curator) in creating the 1769 Seed Archive is awesome - ka mau ke te wehi!
