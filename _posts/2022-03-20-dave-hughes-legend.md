Dave Hughes, who's in his nineties, is a legend at Waikereru.  He's been planting trees here and populating the streams with eels for the past twenty years,  Dave is a keen tramper, still rides his motorbike and has unrivalled knowledge of the bush. He used to trap possums at Waikereru in his teens! Many years ago, he also won the Cresswell Cup for a race from the bottom of Motukeo to the top, back down again and across the swingbridge to the top of Pukeaikuri on our land.  This is his latest gift to Waikereru, two puriri trees.
