Today the Tairāwhiti harakeke varieties from the Orchiston pā harakeke at Waikereru have been shifted from their 20 year old site along the foothills, where the trees were starting to overshade them. 

With funding from the Stout Trust and the Eastern and Central Community Trust, we've created a new wetland, and Claudette Collis, weaver/artist extraordinaire from Tairāwhiti has helped us design a new pā harakeke beside it.  

We look forward to the brilliant art works that will emerge from this new pā, which now has its home alongside all the other rare and endangered Tairāwhiti plants in the 1769 Seed Archive.

Such a fantastic team effort by Malcolm Rutherford, Curator of the 1769 Seed Archive, Fiona Fisher who managed the project (in purple), Claudette and her son, and three wonderful volunteers from Bunnings.  

I just baked the scones for morning tea, and admired their efforts....
