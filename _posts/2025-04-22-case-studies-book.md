Waikereru is featuring in another new book, this time ***Case Studies: A Story of Plant Travel***, a glorious study of the role of Wardian cases in shifting plants around the world.  Our Chair Anne Salmond has contributed a chapter about the botanical collecting in Tairāwhiti by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander on board the Endeavour in 1769, and how this inspired a collective effort involving Anne and Jeremy, Philip Smith, Malcolm Rutherford, Graeme Atkins and Sarosh Mulla to create a safe haven for many of these plants, now rare and endangered, in the [1769 Seed Archive](/1769-garden) at Waikereru.
