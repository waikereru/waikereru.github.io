Another cause for celebration - the lower pond in the new wetland works, with no lining.  The upper pond will need a lining, however.

Looking forward to seeing the rare Tairāwhiti wetland plants arriving and thriving on site, to join the 1769 Seed Archive - including our collection of 20 different Tairāwhiti varieties of harakeke.
