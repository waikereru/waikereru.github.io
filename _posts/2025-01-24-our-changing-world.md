It was a pleasure to host Claire Concannon from RNZ's programme 'Our Changing World' at Waikereru, where we talked about our 'seed island' trial with Tane's Tree Trust and Manaaki Whenua, among other matters.  It led to a slot on Jesse Mulligan's radio programme, a podcast and a couple of RNZ stories on the web:
