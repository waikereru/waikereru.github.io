Our 'seed islands' project is racing ahead, based on expert botanical and geomorphological advice.  The idea is to plant 'seed islands' of diverse native trees scattered among mānuka-kānuka shrublands to speed up the regeneration of biodiverse native forest.  Many thanks to Lotteries and Tāne's Tree Trust for this report by David and Michael Bergin, advising how best to pursue the project.  The seed islands have been planted and, with wet, warm weather, are growing at pace.
