A very sad start to 2023.

Waikereru is mourning the loss of founder Jeremy Salmond, who has contributed so much to the Ecosanctuary - toil, sweat, tears, its quality of design and endless jokes and laughter.

He has been laid to rest beneath a tree at Waikereru, looking out at Motukeo, and watching over his favourite place.
