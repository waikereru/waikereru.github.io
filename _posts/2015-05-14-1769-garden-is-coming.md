Philip Smith of [02 Landscapes](http://www.o2landscapes.com/) has produced this [brilliant plan for the 1769 Seed Archive](/assets/documents/1769GardenPlan.pdf) at Longbush, to be planted in front of the Welcome Shelter. This garden will commemorate the 250th anniversary of the arrival of Captain Cook's Endeavour in 1769 in Gisborne, at the mouth of the WaimatƒÅ River. It features plants that grew in the Tai Rawhiti then, particularly species collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander from the Royal Society party of scientists and artists, and will be a nationally significant garden. Very exciting! [See the plant list attached.](/assets/documents/1769PlantScheduleRevised.pdf)
