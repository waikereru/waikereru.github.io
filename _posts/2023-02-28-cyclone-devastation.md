The start to 2023 has been a nightmare, with Cyclone Hale in January bringing forestry slash down the river, and Cyclone Gabrielle in February blocking the river upstream with slash, wreaking havoc downstream on the river banks and Riverside Road.

Although most of Waikereru is almost untouched, safeguarded by its native forests, the riverside plantings and part of the riverside fence have been buried in silt, the road has been wrecked, Waikereru is inaccessible and the Wild Lab / Tiaki Taiao is suspended.

The Waimat훮 catchment has been devastated, from the headwaters to the heart of Gisborne city.  Its heartbreaking for the Waikereru wh훮nau and whole Waimat훮 Catchment team.
