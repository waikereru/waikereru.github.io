Think like a Forest, a beautiful documentary about our Recloaking Papatūānuku native afforestation project, was launched at the Beehive a week ago.  

Quite a bit of it was filmed at Waikereru, featuring our Chair, Dame Anne; Malcolm Rutherford, curator of the 1769 Seed Archive, and Graeme Atkins, kai tiaki and trustee.

There are community screenings all over the country, and its now up on TVNZ+.
