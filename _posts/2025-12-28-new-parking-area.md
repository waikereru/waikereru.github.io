Thanks so much to the Stout Trust, the Eastern and Central Community Trust and the Gisborne District Council for jointly funding our new wetland, pā harakeke and parking area.

The parking area is a godsend, with all the buses (and cars) that now regularly visit Waikereru - even if they don't always quite make it through the gate!
