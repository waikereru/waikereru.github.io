This morning Malcolm, the 1769 Seed Archive Curator had the pleasure of showing the students from the Certificate of Rongoā at Te Wānanga o Aotearoa around the garden and pā hill track. After a brief introduction to the garden they got stuck into discussion about the plants, conservation, the naming of plants, and lots more. It was great to be able to share some seeds, and other plant material from the garden. After the garden they headed to the Pā Hill track which is predominantly kānuka forest. It has a range of aspects and slopes, so there is a high diversity of species in the understory, many of which have Rongoā properties. The browser control in the area means species such as Hangehange which is often browsed in other areas of bush, is living it’s best life. Malcolm said “It was great to be able to have such a keen group through the garden, and great to have knowledge flowing both ways.”
