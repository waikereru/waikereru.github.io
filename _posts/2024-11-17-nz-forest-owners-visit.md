It was great to welcome the national Environment Committee for the Forest Owners' Association, and the Eastland Woodland Council to Waikereru recently to talk about our Seed Island project, and the prospects for a Recloaking Papatūānuku native afforestation trial in Tairāwhiti.

As we stood beside a porokaiwhiri tree, looking at the regeneration and seed islands on the Waikereru Hills, a shining cuckoo flew into the tree and sang its heart out while the presentation was happening.  Our most eloquent speaker!

Many thanks to Sam Rowland from the Tairāwhiti Environment Centre, Nic Carter and Guido Haag from Ecoworks and Geoff Thorpe from Riversun for their brilliant presentations.

The discussion was expert, practical and constructive, and we look forward to a positive collaboration with FOA and Eastland Wood Council in recloaking the whenua in 3B and other highly erodible sites, especially around waterways in our region.

And heartfelt thanks to Trust Tairāwhiti and Gisborne District Council's Natural Heritage Fund whose support is helping to make the Seed Island project possible.
