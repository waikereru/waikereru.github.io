The [Gisborne Harriers](https://www.facebook.com/GisborneHarriers/) descended on Waikereru for their annual Longbush run, in support of the [Gisborne Stroke Foundation](https://www.gisbornestrokesupport.org.nz/).  Brilliant turnout with 86 runners participating - looks like a great day was had by all!
