It would be fascinating to know how much carbon is stored in our trees at Waikereru.  The [scientists at Kew Gardens in London](https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/kew-carbon-trees-draw-down) have used [LIDAR, a laser 3D imaging technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar), to find out.  Turns out most of the carbon is stored below ground in the soil and networks of fungi beneath the forest. Read more here:

From the [article](https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/kew-carbon-trees-draw-down):

> Based on data gathered from UK Forest Research (Waring et al. 2020), in temperate forests in the UK approximately
>
> - 17% of the total carbon is stored in tree above-ground tissues,
> - 6% is stored in roots  
> - 5% is stored in surface litter and dead wood, and
> - a vast **72%** stays in the soil where it can remain for long periods helping to mitigate climate change.
