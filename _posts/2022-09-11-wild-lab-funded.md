The Wild Lab Tiaki Taiao is celebrating a major success, securing funding from the Ministry of Education for its workshops for students, and for teachers for the next three years.  This brilliant programme is gaining national and international recognition - and thanks to its initial funder, the Air New Zealand Environment Trust.  

Can't wait to see what happens next..
