Fabulous visit to a temperate rainforest restoration project on the island of Mull in west Scotland. This Holly tree dates back to 1730 in an ancient oak and holly woodland, largely cleared for Sitka pine trees after WWII.  Moray Finch, recently retired Director of the project, told us how how dendrochronology was used to date it.
