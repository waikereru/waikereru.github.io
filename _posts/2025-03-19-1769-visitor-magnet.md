A stream of interesting experts have visited Waikereru lately, attracted by the 1769 Seed Archive and our seed islands project.  

They include Dr. John Craig and Anne Stewart from Tahi Estate, a fabulous large-scale restoration project in Northland; and Celia Wade-Brown, former Mayor of Wellington and now MP, among others:
