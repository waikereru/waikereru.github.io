Bad news from DoC's Community Conservation Fund. No ongoing pest and weed control funding for Waikereru.  Not sure how our Trust could do more to support biodiversity outcomes (1769 Seed Archive) or work more closely with our community, nationally and locally (Te Awaroa: Voice of the River project, advocacy for native forests, Wild Lab Tiaki Taiao wilderness education, WaimatƒÅ River restoration etc etc).

Feel like a punch drunk kereru..
