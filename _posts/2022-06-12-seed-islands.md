We're figuring out how to use strategic 'seed island' plantings in manuka-kanuka regenerating shrublands on the Waikereru Hills to speed up the restoration of biodiverse native forest. This terrific project is funded by Lotteries, and is being executed by our expert team - Steve Sawyer, David and Michael Bergin of Tane's Tree Trust, Marley Ford and Dr. Mike Marden from Landcare Research.
