 Thanks to the generous support of the Stout Trust and the Eastern and Central Trust, we're establishing a new wetland by the 1769 Seed Archive for Tairāwhiti wetland varieties, including our collection of harakeke from the region and some favorite muka varieties, as requested by the weavers.  Claudette Collis, renowned kairaranga from Uawa, who also has whakapapa to Te Aitanga-a-Māhaki and Te Whānau-a-Apanui (she's a Stirliing!) is supervising the planting.

We're also taking the opportunity to erect a marvellous taonga from Sarosh Mulla, prize-winning designer of the Welcome Shelter - 'The Living Room.'  This ingenious frame will feature indigenous climbing plants, so that visitors can walk inside and see the world through their leaves.  Heartfelt thanks to Sarosh for another brilliant gift to Waikereru.
