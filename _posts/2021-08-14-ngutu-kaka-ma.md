The marvellous gift of 20 ngutu kākā mā - rare white kākā beak plants - from Ngāti Kohatu and Ngāti Hinehika, and artist Raewyn Atkinson is now in its full glory.  

The plants struggled for a couple of years, and had to be carefully protected from hares and rabbits with large chicken wire cages, but they've flourished this winter and are now covered with flowers.

Ka nui a mātou mihi aroha ki a rātou mō tēnei koha rangatira, ataahua hoki!
