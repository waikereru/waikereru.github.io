What a magic summer at Longbush! A kids' art exhibition with Pete and Elle Jarratt in Longbush Reserve; 11 titi installed in artificial burrows up in the Waikereru Hills, with the blessing of Ngai Tamanuhiri; a visit by the Home Schools Enviroschools children, filmed by Ian Ruru; Phillip Smith and his family staying with us - more thinking about the 1769 Seed Archive. Fabulous fun.
