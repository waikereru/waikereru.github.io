Great to see Pete and Elle work their magic in another Wild Lab workshop, this time inspiring local children to engage with the plants in the 1769 Seed Archive.

The head teacher's comments?: " I haven't been there before, the location was perfect. The combo of site and people was amazing. They are kids of heart and the inner kids came out in them."
