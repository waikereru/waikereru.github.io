​It was a pleasure to host Pär Ahlberger, the Swedish ambassador, to Waikereru.  He was fascinated by the 1769 Seed Archive, with its plants collected by Joseph Banks and Dr. Carl Solander (favourite student of the great Swedish naturalist Linnaeus) during the Endeavour's visit to Tairawhiti in 1769.
