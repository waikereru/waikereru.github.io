'Waikereru,' an ancestral place name, means 'water frequented by kereru (native pigeons).'  It refers to the birds that live around the streams, in the forest and along the banks of the Waimatā river.

We see Waikereru as a living community of land, water, plants, animals and people. In the research that guides the restoration work at Waikereru, we want to understand each of these different life forms, and how they've lived together and changed through time. 

Waikereru sits at the heart of the Waimatā river community. In the ['Let the River Speak' research project](/research/#let-the-river-speak), we explore the life of the Waimatā river from its beginnings about a million years ago to the present, and the future. The aim is to restore ora (life, well-being, prosperity) to as many of these different life forms as possible.

The [1769 Seed Archive](/1769-garden/), with its rare and endangered Tairāwhiti plants, the [Wild Lab / Tiaki Taiao programme](/wildlab/) for local school children, the pā harakeke, the restoration work with river, streams and forests and the ['Let the River Speak' research programme](/research/#let-the-river-speak) are all part of this regenerative project.

## History

### The Land

Waikereru is encircled by a ring of steep hills, with Motukeo to the east – a sacred mountain for local iwi, a fishing mark out at sea and a leaping off place for spirits, and Te Ai ā Te Kurī to the west. 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/history/motukeo-dawn.jpg" caption="Motukeo at dawn" %}

When the first Europeans arrived in the district, the flats and foothills in the Waimatā valley were covered with fern or gardens, with dense lowland bush and trees in the high valleys and inland. The place is named for the flocks of kereru (native pigeons) that live in the forest.

A small unfortified village once stood on the low hill at Waikereru (Pā Hill), looking up and down the Waimatā River, with pits for kūmara or possibly potatoes dug into the summit and one of the terraced spurs.

In the mid 1860s Raharuhi Rukupō, one of the leading rangatira (chiefs) in the district, set aside the Whataupoko block (including Waikereru) and sent men to fetch European settlers from Hawkes Bay to establish a sheep farm. Henry Parker took up the offer and began farming sheep on the block, followed by his brother William Parker.

When legal title to the land was established in 1869, the local chiefs settled its ownership among themselves. They included Raharuhi Rukupō, the chieftainess Riparata Kahutia and the Aitanga-ā-Māhaki chief [Hirini te Kani](https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1t40/te-kani-hirini). Longbush lies in that part of the block associated with Te Aitanga-ā -Māhaki, a local iwi or descent group.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/history/hirini-te-kani-card.jpg" caption="Hirini Te Kani, Te Aitanga-ā-Māhaki" %}

In 1885 the ownership of the Whataupoko No.9 block passed to the New Zealand Native Land Settlement Company, which sold part of it to John Dunlop. From that time, the Waikereru Station (3300 acres) was worked as a pastoral farm, with two families, the Donners and the Hegartys, running the farm from 1895 to 1990. For further details, see [Gordon Jackman's excellent archaeological report on Waikereru](/assets/documents/ArchaeologicalAssessmentGordonJackman.pdf).

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/history/site-panorama-1942.jpg" caption="The site as it looked in 1942, Malcom Rutherford" %}

The Hegartys created a pond below Pā Hill, and planted a stand of Italian veneer poplars from Ruakura. By 1989 the hills had been cleared, leaving only a strip of lowland bush alongside the Waimatā River.

This was known as Longbush, a favourite picnic spot for local families (including the Thorpes, Anne’s family). On hot summer days Anne and her brothers and sisters, like many other Gisborne kids, would cycle up the long, winding gravel road to Longbush and swim in the Waimatā River.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/history/Early-days-at-the-Pond.jpg" caption="Early days at the pond" %}

After the trees on the land were felled, the slopes began to slip. During Cyclone Bola in 1988, there was severe slumping in the foothills, and large quantities of sediment were dumped in the Waimatā River, destroying the Longbush swimming hole.

In 2000 when Jeremy and Anne Salmond purchased the land, Waikereru was under severe ecological threat. Cattle grazed the hills and the riverside bush, and the forest floor was barren. Garden rubbish and other refuse including cars were dumped in the gullies or beside the river.

### The Project

#### Stage one - Longbush Reserve

In 2001 the project began when Longbush Reserve, the riverside bush, was fenced and placed under a QEII covenant.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="/assets/images/history/initial-fencing-2003.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/history/initial-fencing-2003.jpg"></a>

    <figcaption>Initial fencing and planting work</figcaption>
</figure>

The following year, Steve Sawyer of [Ecoworks](http://www.ecoworks.co.nz/) began an intensive programme of weed control and trapping opossums, rats, stoats, weasels and wild cats.

The owners worked with Andy Carrie from the Conservation Corps at Tairāwhiti Polytechnic to plant the clearings.

The restoration of the bush along the Waimatā River is now complete (although ongoing maintenance is essential). The results to date have been dramatic.

The forest floor has been colonised by kawakawa and other plants, and rare plants including black and hooded green orchids are re-emerging ([See list of plants at Longbush](/assets/documents/SpeciesList.pdf)).

The numbers of indigenous birds including kereru, tui, bell-bird, fantail, kingfisher and rūrū (native owls) have markedly increased, with sightings of rare species including whiteheads, weka and the New Zealand falcon.

Grey geckos, long-tailed bats and black-headed tree weta live in the bush, and weta from the Longbush Ecosanctuary have been used as a source population for a tuatara and petrel re-introduction project at Young Nick’s Head in Gisborne.

The Longbush Ecosanctuary is now the only area in the Tūranga Ecological District with such high remaining levels of biodiversity. Almost every other remnant forest area has high pest densities and abundant exotic weeds.


#### Stage two - the wildlife corridors

The second stage in the restoration of the Longbush Ecosanctuary was to create wildlife corridors between the Reserve and regenerating bush in the valleys, which are themselves adjacent to large QEII covenanted areas on several other properties across the western ridge.

This began in 2000 with a planting by members of the Thorpe family, followed by plantings by the Conservation Corps at Tairāwhiti Polytechnic from 2001-6. In 2006 the Biodiversity Fund awarded a grant to support this step in the programme, followed by a three year grant over 2007-9.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/history/early-planting.jpg" caption="Initial Wildlife corridor plantings" %}

Since then, wildlife corridors have been created along the three streams which run down the valleys from the high western ridges, across the flats and down to the Waimatā River. The most southerly of these corridors has been allowed to regenerate naturally, while those along the middle and most northerly streams have been created by fencing and planting.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/history/arboretum-july-05.jpg" caption="Arboretum, circa 2005" %}

Groves of berry-bearing trees (titoki, karaka, pūriri and taraire) and the [Rene Orchiston collection](http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/research/biosystematics/plants/harakeke/) of 60 varieties of harakeke (New Zealand flax) have been planted along the foothills to provide seasonal food supplies for native birds. A group of local weavers led by Meikle McNab of Ngāti Porou care for the [Orchiston collection](http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/research/biosystematics/plants/harakeke/), which is regarded as a national taonga or treasure.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/history/janine-te-reo.jpg" caption="Janine Te Reo, kai-tiaki, Orchiston Pā Harakeke" %}


#### Stage three - Waikereru

In 2005, Longbush Reserve was recognised as a **Priority 1 RAP** (recommended area for protection) by the Department of Conservation.

Waikereru has many advantages for long-term ecological restoration. It is close to Gisborne City, an ideal site for educational programmes.

The riverside bush and the hill area are protected by QEII covenants, with several other large QEII covenanted blocks across the western ridge.

The corridors for wildlife are already in place, with good seed stocks and established populations of many species of native birds in the Ecosanctuary and the PMA across the river. Three creeks run from the ridgelines across the flats to the Waimatā River, providing a variety of habitats.

In 2009 the **[Longbush Ecological Trust](/team/)**, which is responsible for the restoration of both Longbush Reserve and Waikereru, was set up to restore the covenanted areas. A [Management Plan](/assets/documents/LongbushAndWaikereruManagementPlan.pdf) was produced outlining future opportunities for the conservation of Longbush Reserve and Waikereru.

Medium-term initiatives include [Make Longbush Longer](/assets/documents/MakeLongbushLonger.pdf), a community project to restore bush to the banks of the Waimatā River; and Friends of the Waimatā, a community network which aims to restore the waters feeding the Waimatā to their original state, with clear, slow-flowing streams and ponds, full of life and indigenous freshwater species.

In 2010 Waikereru was established. The sheep that grazed the hills were removed, and a programme of intensive pest and weed control, planting in the foothills and natural regeneration in the valleys is well under way.

This is by far the most ambitious phase of the project to date, aiming to restore 100 hectares of hill country as a haven for locally extinct indigenous species of birds, plants and animals, including brown kiwi, weka, robin, tomtit, kākāriki, kākā, rifleman, East Coast kaka beak and broom, forest and green gecko.

This will be the largest fully protected area in the Tairāwhiti region (from Opotiki to Wairoa, including the hinterland) with the sustained predator and weed control that allows these species to survive and flourish.

During 2011, a small predator-free enclosure was built in the Waikereru hills, and five oi (grey-faced petrel) chicks were successfully translocated and reared, and flew off to the Pacific ([see attached report](/assets/documents/FirstYearTitiProjectReport.pdf)). 

During 2012, ten chicks were reared at Longbush, and 16 chicks in 2016, flying off on their Pacific migration.

These are the first steps towards establishing an inland oi [grey-faced petrel] colony at Waikereru - a world first. Although oi and other seabirds were a traditional source of guano to feed the native plants and trees, inland colonies of oi (once numerous) are now rare in New Zealand.

A predator-free fence in the Waikereru hills for Eastern brown kiwi, kākāriki, kākā and rifleman is also planned, with a kiwi creche behind the Welcome Shelter – the **Kohanga Kiwi / Kiwi Haven**. In front of the Welcome Shelter, the 1769 Seed Archive has been established, with tracks around Pā Hill and the pond.

In 2019, the Wild Lab Tiaki Taiao educational programme for local kids will get under way, after a series of trial workshops. Key events since 2012 are covered in the ‘News’ section of the website.


### A ten year plan for Waikereru

## Waimatā River

The waters of the Waimatā run past the places where our shared history began. Fed by springs and streams, its headwaters rise in the hills north-east of Gisborne and run down to the city, with its harbour and port.

Opposite the Waikanae Stream, a sacred rock, Te Toka-a-Taiau (now underwater) marks the arrival of the voyaging canoes Horouta and Takitimu. At the river mouth, Captain James Cook and his companions stepped ashore in October 1769, the first Europeans to land in New Zealand.

Many people live on the banks of the Waimatā - farming families in the high country and urban dwellers in town. Its winding valley gives access by road to the hinterland, with its forests and farms.

Kayakers, rowers, waka ama paddlers, kids on rafts and fishers all use the river. In the city, the Waimatā and the Taraheru carved out the harbour on which the port, the marina, the fishing club and many cafes are built.

### The Waimatā is in trouble

Today, the Waimatā is in trouble. Pastoral farming in steep, unstable country has led to severe erosion. Sediment flows into the river. The banks are grazed by stock in many places, leaving them bare of bush cover. When it rains, the river turns to liquid mud.

In the headwaters, exotic forests planted to protect the hills are being clear felled. Tracks scar the ridges, and when it rains heavily, piles of slash (logging debris) and bark wash down the slopes. With no bush buffers, sediment and debris are swept into the streams, down the river into the harbour, and onto the beaches. Sediment clogs the port and local fisheries.

See Ian Ruru’s eloquent video about the Waimatā, ‘A River in Tears’.

### The tide is turning

The tide is turning. International markets for timber, meat and wool now demand products that meet high environmental standards.

The Forestry Stewardship Council requires bush buffers around waterways in forests, and 10% of each forest to be devoted to native species. Foresters who breach these standards risk losing their access to world markets.

Around New Zealand, people no longer take their rivers for granted. In many places, foresters, farmers, local bodies and residents are joining together to protect their waterways.


### The Future of the Waimatā

Many people live beside the Waimatā river, use it, or cross it every day. Surf life savers, surfers, paddlers, sailors, fishers and walkers all want to see forestry debris and logs removed from the river, the sea and the beaches.

In the headwaters, large areas are controlled by a few forestry companies that belong to the Forestry Stewardship Council, with its high environmental standards.

The port has a commercial interest in reducing sediment loadings in the river, and its dredging bills. Ratepayers and the Council will benefit if repair bills for roads and other infrastructure damaged by flooding can be limited.


### Te Awaroa

At the 2012 Transit of Venus Forum in Gisborne, our Chairperson came up with the idea of **[Te Awaroa](/assets/documents/TeAwaroaForestAndBird.pdf)**, a project to take care of waterways across New Zealand. This would restore integrity to our 100% Pure New Zealand brand, create wildlife corridors for endangered species and cleanse the water, enhancing the beauty of our rivers for kayakers, swimmers, paddlers, rowers and fishers. 

Watch [Dan Hikuroa talk about Te Awaroa](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/@future-learning/2018/10/01/260029/another-approach-to-our-freshwater-crisis), or read the [Strategic Plan](/assets/documents/TeAwaroaStrategicPlan.pdf) for more information on this project.


### Guardians of the Waimatā

The Te Awaroa team have conducted a case study of the Waimatā River, producing reports on its geomorphology, Maori and settler histories, and the ecology of the from the mountains to the sea (See [report on the ecology of the Waimatā](/assets/documents/BiodiversityInTheWaimataCatchmentReport.pdf)).

The next stage is to share these insights into the past and present of the Waimatā River with the community, and seek to ensure that it returns to a state of ora (well-being, abundance).

### Waimatā Catchment Restoration Inc. established

In July 2020, after another workshop was held at the Waimatā River Valley Hall, [Waimatā Catchment Restoration Inc.](https://www.facebook.com/Waimata-Catchment-Restoration-Project-112407203838612/) was set up, and officers elected.

The Waimatā River restoration project is now in full swing, supported by a $500,000 grant from the Erosion Control funding.  This pilot project is funding fencing and planting on 7 properties, and farm environment plans for all farms in the catchment.

Waimatā Catchment Restoration Inc. now has its own [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Waimata-Catchment-Restoration-Project-112407203838612/), where you can keep in touch with the project as it progresses.


### Let the River Speak

***Ko au te awa, ko te awa ko au. Kei te mate te awa, kei te mate ahau.***<br/>
*I am the river, and the river is me.  If the river is dying, so am I.*

This Marsden research project, led by Principal Investigators Dame Anne Salmond and Dr. Dan Hikuroa at the University of Auckland, builds on New Zealand legislation which, for the first time in the world, recognises a river as having its own life and rights.

In this research, the Waimatā is regarded as a living community of land, water, plants, animals and people. We aim to explore the life of this river community through time, from its beginnings about 1 million years ago to the present, examining its dynamics and working with others to restore it to a state of ora - health, well being and flourishing.

At present, the Waimatā river community faces many challenges, including past land use decisions, climate change and biodiversity losses. 

The river, which is tightly constrained by its terraces, acts like a chute. In severe rain events, rafts of forestry slash, logs and trees surge down steep, highly erodible hillsides, carving out gullies and choking the river with sediment. 

As they are swept down river, the rafts jam on bridges and steep corners, creating dams and mini-tsunamis when the dams burst, destroying river banks, roads, bridges, fences, paddocks, orchards, farm buildings and homes. 

During these flood events, sewage and wastewater are released into the Waimatā, making it toxic for freshwater species and people. As slash and sediment are deposited on the bed of the river, it is rising, threatening Gisborne city, which is built on a flood plain.

In response to these challenges, the *'Let the River Speak'* research team are studying the geology, geomorphology, hydrology, ecology, human history and social life of the Waimatā river, drawing upon mātauranga as well as cutting edge science to understand its dynamics. We aim to work with local people on planning for flood resilience, sustainable land use and the restoration of riparian forests and wetlands in the catchment, so that the Waimatā river community can flourish and thrive.
