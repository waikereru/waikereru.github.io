## The founders

When Anne and Jeremy Salmond first visited Longbush together in 1970 after a family picnic at Longbush Reserve, they were struck by its beauty.

He was the author of Old New Zealand Houses 1800-1940, a former Chairman of [ICOMOS](http://www.icomos.org.nz/) (International Commission of Monuments and Sites) in New Zealand, and was awarded the Queen’s Service Order and the NZIA Gold Medal.
