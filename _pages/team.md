## The founders

When Anne and Jeremy Salmond first visited Longbush together in 1970 after a family picnic at Longbush Reserve, they were struck by its beauty.

**[Jeremy Salmond](https://salmondreed.co.nz/about#jeremy-salmond)** was a conservation architect and founding partner of [Salmond Reed Architects](http://salmondreed.co.nz/) in Auckland. He was the author of Old New Zealand Houses 1800-1940, a former Chairman of [ICOMOS](http://www.icomos.org.nz/) (International Commission of Monuments and Sites) in New Zealand, and was awarded the Queen’s Service Order and the NZIA Gold Medal.

### Steve Sawyer

At the end of 2002, Anne and Jeremy contacted **[Steve Sawyer](/assets/documents/TheBirdWhispererSteveSawyer.pdf)**, who was about to leave the Department of Conservation to set up his own ecological restoration business, [Ecoworks NZ](http://www.ecoworks.co.nz/). Steve is a vital part of the Longbush project, bringing vision and expertise to its execution.

Steve coordinates the Kiwi Recovery Programme in the Gisborne-East Coast Region. He is an expert in pest and weed control, and native reptile and seabird restoration. He and his Ecoworks NZ team were the first in the world to successfully use acoustic attraction methods to establish breeding grey faced petrel and fluttering shearwater (at Young Nick’s Head), and a breeding colony of gannets.
