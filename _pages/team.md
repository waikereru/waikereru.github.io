## Our ecological experts

### Steve Sawyer

At the end of 2002, Anne and Jeremy contacted **[Steve Sawyer](/assets/documents/TheBirdWhispererSteveSawyer.pdf)**, who was about to leave the Department of Conservation to set up his own ecological restoration business, [Ecoworks NZ](http://www.ecoworks.co.nz/). Steve is a vital part of the Longbush project, bringing vision and expertise to its execution.
